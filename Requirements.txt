Here's a sample requirements.txt file based on the dependencies in your project:


Flask==2.0.1
psycopg2==2.9.1
pytesseract==0.3.8
Pillow==8.2.0
pdf2image==1.16.0

Explanation of Each Dependency

Flask: The web framework you’re using to build the application.

psycopg2: Required for connecting to PostgreSQL from Flask.

pytesseract: Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR, used for extracting text from images.

Pillow: The Python Imaging Library, which is necessary for handling image files created from PDFs.

pdf2image: Converts PDF pages to images so they can be processed by Tesseract.

Additional Installation Notes:

If you’re using Tesseract, make sure it’s installed on your system separately, as it’s not a Python package and won’t be installed via requirements.txt.

To install these packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This file should cover all the essential dependencies for your project. Let me know if there are other libraries you’ve included that should be added!
